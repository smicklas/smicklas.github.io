I"\<p>In 2017, I worked with two other student on an Android app and companion web app, called “PupAlert”, over the course of a semester. This was my first experience with Android app development and Agile development. 
<br /><br />
PupAlert’s primary functionality is to view &amp; share pictures of dogs in the area. It is built with Android in Java, and stored data with Firebase. 
<br /><br /></p>

<div style="text-align: center; border-top:none;">
    <img src="assets\images\rideshare_1.png" alt="" width="" height="" />
    <img src="assets\images\rideshare_2.png" alt="" />
    <img src="assets\images\rideshare_3.png" alt="" />
    <img src="assets\images\rideshare_4.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The app allows users to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Log in with their Google account</li>
  <li>Upload a picture of a dog with a location tag</li>
  <li>View an card post feed of other posted dogs, the location, and a relative time stamp</li>
  <li>View a map with location markers corresponding to the post
<br /><br />
I contributed to the design, layout, and functionality for creating a post. Additionality responsibitlies included backlog management, generation of burn-down charts, and creating stakeholder demo presentations after the completion of sprints.
