I"_<p>During a class titled “Human-Computer Interactions &amp; Usability”, I worked with a team of developers and humantities students to create a final product for an external client. We were assigned a representative from the Oklahoma Conversation Commission. During bi-weekly meetings with the client, we elicited requirements, refined our current product, and ensure a common understanding. Usability tests were conducted using other students. Documents produced during this process include meeting minutes from weekly developer sessions, design documents, database schemas, and cognitive walkthrough. 
<br /><br />
The final product is a forum-based information hub that allows users to post questions for professionals to respond to, view the FAQ, view a list of vendors and soil information professionals in their area, and view a news feed from the site managers. 
<br /><br />
It was developed using Ruby on Rails with Bootstrap componenents. Travis CI was used to monitor build successes failures, as well as Discord webhooks to keep the team up to date wit hte curernt build as soon at the code is pushed to the repository. 
<br /><br />
The final product is deployed using Heroku and can be viewed <a href="https://team-6-soil.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. (Please note that there may be a small wait until the page connects - the Heroku instance must wake up.)</p>
