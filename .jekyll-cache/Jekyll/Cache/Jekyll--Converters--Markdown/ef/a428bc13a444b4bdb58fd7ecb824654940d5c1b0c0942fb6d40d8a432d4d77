I"l<p>During my time at Michigan Technological University, I contributed to the development of 3 Unity game engine video games, written in C#. During that time, I had the privilege of being part of rotating teams comprised of sound engineers, visual developers, and programmers. Development of each game took place in an Agile setting. Each game required the development of pre-mortems, trailers, regular Sprint progress documents, final deliverables, and extensive playtesting.</p>
