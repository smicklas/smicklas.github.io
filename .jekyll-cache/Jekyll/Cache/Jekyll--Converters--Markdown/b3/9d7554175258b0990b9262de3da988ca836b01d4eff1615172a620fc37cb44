I"D<p>In 2017, I worked with two other student on an Android app and companion web app, called “Pup Alert”, over the course of a semester. This was my first experience with Android app development and Agile development. 
<br /><br />
PupAlert was created as an app to view &amp; share pictures of dogs in the area. 
<br /><br /></p>

<p>The app was built with Android in Java, and stored data with Firebase. 
<br />
The app allows users to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Log in with their Google account</li>
  <li>Upload a picture of a dog with a location tag</li>
  <li>View an card post feed of other posted dogs, the location, and a relative time stamp</li>
  <li>View a map with location markers corresponding to the post 
<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<p>I specifically contributed to the design, layout, and functionality for creating a post.</p>
