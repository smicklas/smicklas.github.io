At Michigan Tech, I spent four semesters developing, designing and testing games with a variety of multi-disciplinary teams in a class called <a href="https://huskygames.com/"> Husky Game Development</a>. Each Fall semester, teams were assembled and quickly got to work crafting elevator pitch presentations to our faculty advisor and board of student leaders. After the pitch is approved (evaluated on clear premise, development plan, and minimum viable product feasibility), we spent the semester working in sprints developing, refining, and creating progress reports. 

My favorite project that I worked on was Orbital Commander - a couch co-op style game featuring realistic physics and pixel graphics. My specific contributions included development of assets, coding for some of the powerups, map development, and editing & filming of the trailer.
