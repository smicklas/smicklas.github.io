This project is a quiz game to test user's knowledge of League of Legends abilities developed with React. 

The champion abillity, image, name, key binding, and description from this site content: <a href="https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/abilities">https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/abilities</a> and then displaying it in plain text. 

This project, like many, started with some mockups - screenshots below were created in Figma. 

<div class="siema">

    <img src="/assets/images/AbilityQuiz-Correct.png" alt="Mockup of League of Legends Ability Quiz"/>
</div>
<div class="gallery-button-container center">
    <button class="prev center gallery-button"><i class="fas fa-backward" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>
    <button class="next center gallery-button"><i class="fas fa-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>
</div>

My goal was to closely mimic the style of the style used in the <a href="https://www.chiboost.net/upload/2019/03/IMAGE-FOR-LOL-CLIENT-SPEC-MODE-1024x576.jpg">League of Legends launcher</a>, <a href="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_912,h_516,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/5afde7387134f68573000003.png">champ select</a>, and <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">website</a>. 

It was briefly hosted on Heroku for other League of Legends players to play test.
