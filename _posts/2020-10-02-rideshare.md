---

As a design excercise, I created design boards for a ride sharing/carpooling Android app. The app is designed to help pair drivers, who input where they will be driving to and from, and riders who can request to join drivers along their route.

Use the buttons below to swipe through the various screens. 

Designs created using Adobe Xd.
