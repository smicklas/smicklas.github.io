In 2017, I worked with two other student on an Android app and companion web app, called “PupAlert”, over the course of a semester. This was my first experience with Android app development and Agile development. 
<br><br>
PupAlert's primary functionality is to view & share pictures of dogs in the area. It is built with Android in Java, and stored data with Firebase. 
<br><br>

<div style="text-align: center; border-top:none;">
    <img src="assets\images\pupalert_1.jpg" alt="" width="25%" height="25%"/>
    <img src="assets\images\pupalert_2.jpg" alt="" width="25%" height="25%"/>
    <img src="assets\images\pupalert_3.jpg" alt="" width="25%" height="25%"/>
    <img src="assets\images\pupalert_4.jpg" alt="" width="25%" height="25%"/>
</div>

The app allows users to:
* Log in with their Google account
* Upload a picture of a dog with a location tag 
* View an card post feed of other posted dogs, the location, and a relative time stamp
* View a map with location markers corresponding to the post
<br><br>
I contributed to the design, layout, and functionality for creating a post. Additionality responsibitlies included backlog management, generation of burn-down charts, and creating stakeholder demo presentations after the completion of sprints.
