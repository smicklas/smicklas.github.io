Hi, I'm Sydney! ðŸ’•

I'm a software engineer in Indiana. I'm a Midwest enthusiast who was born and raised in the mitten of Michigan.

I currently make cool Android applications. Frontend development and web design have a soft spot in my heart. 

In my previous role I worked extensively with React, JQuery, Coldfusion, and Unity.

I strive to create applications that are as beautiful in their code as they are in design. 

I graduated Michigan Technological University in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering.

Some of my projects include Compose apps, React experiments, wearables, and other mobile-based experiences. 

In my off time I enjoy video games, weight lifting, roller skating, crafts, and walking my pup.
