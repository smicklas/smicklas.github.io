<h3>As you may have already seen, my name is Sydney Micklas.</h3>
I'm a software developer from Michigan. 
<br> 
<br>
I graduated from Michigan Technological University in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering.   
<br>
<br>
I'm oriented towards full-stack development, and I'll never say no to an opportunity to grow through new technologies. 
<br>
<br>
In the past I've had the pleasure of working with many teams for projects such as game development, Android apps, Node APIs, Ruby on Rails sites, and Sharepoint management. For more information, head on over to my portfolio.   
<br>
<br>
My current endeavors involve Android development, React, and Arduino programming.  
<br>
<br>
My spare time is comprised of:
<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Weightlifting </li>
		<li>Walking</li>
		<li>Tinkering</li>
		<li>Home DIY projects </li>
	</ul>
