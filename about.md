My name is Sydney Micklas! 

I'm a software developer originally from Michigan, currently living in Indiana.

I attended Michigan Technological University in 2019 and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering.

I'm oriented towards front-end development for web and mobile, but I'll never say no to an opportunity to grow through new technologies.

I strive to create web applications that are as beautiful in their code as they are in design. 

Some of my more recent projects include React web apps, wearables, and mobile-based experiences. 

In my current job, I work extensively with React, JQuery, Coldfusion, and Unity.

In my off time I enjoy video games, weight lifting, cross stitching, and doodling.
