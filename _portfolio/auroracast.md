First personal project using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Site retrieves location, and using the user location, will retrieve cloud coverage. Animated cloud opcaity changes based on the reported cloud coverage.
From there, using NOAA's tabular aurora borealis percentage data, will show the chance of visible aurora with a basic text change and by changing glow around main circle.
