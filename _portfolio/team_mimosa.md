In 2017, I worked with two other student on an android app, called ["Pup Alert"](https://github.com/TeamMimosa/PupAlert-android), over the course of a semester. 
This was my first experience with Android add development. 

PupAlert was created as an app to view & share dogs in the area. First view is a map view, that displays your location on Google maps. Posts to PupAlert are displayed as red markers.

Users sign in through Google. View will then show Google details.

Users can post picture, or upload from gallery. General location is displayed at the time of post creation.

![pupalert_5]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pexels/pupalert_5.jpg)

Users can view post feed, which displays other users' posts and relative time posted.
