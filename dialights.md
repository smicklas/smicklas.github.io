A personal project inspired by popular lighting piece Nanoleaf, DiaLights are RGB wall art panels.  

The physical component, the panels themselves, are composed of an Adrduino Nano, a Bluetooth module, strip RGB LEDs, and 3D printed frames. The frames were modelled using AutoDesk AutoCad.

<br>
<br>

The app was developed using the Android SDK in Java. The Arduino code is written in C++. The app sends serial data to the Bluetooth module, connected to a data pin on the Arduino.

The individual panel colors can be controlled individually, synced to one color, turned on and off, or set to slowly pulse through a range of colors.
